ngram file format:
'ngram TAB year TAB match_count TAB volume_count NEWLINE'

Problem: For each year available, plot the size of the set of words used. Year on the x-axis, number of words on y-axis.


1) Map each line to a tuple as (<year>, <ngram>).
2) Use the 'groupByKey()' function to group all ngrams for a year.
3) Map each (<year>, <ngram data>) tuple to (<year>, len(set(<ngram data>)))
4) Collect each (<year>, <# distinct ngrams>) tuple for the year.
