+ Centroid Search (65 mile threshold)

  - Read the file...
    .textFile('hdfs://path/to/file')
    .count()

  - Trim locations to a 65 mile radius -> (<lat,lon>, 1)
    .map(trim_locations)
    .count()

+ Ratio of location:total is the percentage of tweeters with locations

  - If no location, throw it out
    .filter(filter_locations)

  - Merge keys with the same <lat,lon>++
    .reduceByKey(reduce_locations)

  - Get the max value from the <lat,lon>, this is the centroid
    .max(max_locations)
