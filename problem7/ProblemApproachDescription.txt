For those tweets with location information, what lat/long (or city/state) is the centroid?
What was the proportion of tweets with location to those without?

Centroid:
-Stage 1 (Map)
  -Sort the users who have locations
  -Truncate the latitude and longitudes to a comma seperated key mapped to a count
  -Output the keys and counts
-Stage 1 (Reduce)
  -Combine the keys that are matching
  -Track the max lat,lon pair
