For those tweets with location information, what lat/long (or city/state) is the centroid?
What was the proportion of tweets with location to those without?

Centroid:
-Stage 1
  -Sort the users who have locations
  -Truncate the latitude and longitudes to a comma seperated key mapped to a count
  -Output the keys and counts
-Stage 2
  -Combine the keys that are matching
  -Track the max lat,lon pair
-Results
  -Centroid of locations: 39,-84 (Gives a maximum radius buffer of 65 miles)
  -Total count of appearances: 320007

Count&Average:
-Stage 1
  -Count the users who have locations
  -Sum all users
-Stage 2
  -Take the ratio of users
-Results
  -Users who have location: 1868302
  -Percentage of users who have location: 0.307271250671%
