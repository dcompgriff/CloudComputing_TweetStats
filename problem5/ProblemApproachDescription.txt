Most tweets twitter user:
-Stage 1:
       -Find sum of tweets for each user.
       -output <uname>, 1 from map stage.
       -Sum counts in reduce.
-Stage 2:
       -Use top 10 design pattern to find top frequency tweeter.
       -Find top tweeter in each mapper.
       -Find top tweeter in the reducer set.

Top 5 longest average tweeters:
-Stage 1:
       -Find number of tweets and sum of tweet lengths for each user in map-reduce fashion.
       -Use key for user sum of tweets, and sum of tweet lengths.
       -<uname>_count, <uname>_sum
-Stage 2:
       -Calculate average tweet length for each user.
       -Parse each input key from <uname>_count to <uname>, ('count', <count val>)
       -Find average in the reduce stage.
-Stage 3:
       -Use top 10 design pattern on each user to find the top 5 longest average tweet length for the users.
       -For each map phase, find the top 5.
       -In the reduce phase, find the top 5 of the top 5 sets.

Bottom 5 longest average tweeters:
-Same approach as top 5, but with selecting bottom 5 for each data set.
